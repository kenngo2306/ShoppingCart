# ShoppingCart

Evil Bank and Gulp have teamed up to create an online store.

Your job is to find ten products for them to sell. Then create a database for those products. Next, create a dynamic web application using JPA to serve as a shopping cart for the Evil-Gulp store.

Your application should allow the user to view a list of products (pictures are optional) and select a product to add to the shopping cart.

Each product should contain a name, description and price and any other information you want to add. The products must be stored in the database.

The user should be able to browse the list, see product details and add the product. Then the user can go back to the list or can go to the cart to checkout.

So, you should have the following pages:

Product List Page
Product Details Page
Shopping Cart Page that shows all the items in the shopping cart
Order Confirmation  that shows the total amount of the items ordered
 

The order confirmation page should display a summary of the order.
